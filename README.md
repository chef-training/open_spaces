Every event should have a Chef AMA? (Ask Me Anything?)

For the first day the main room is open to a large AMA

One every day. At the beginning of the day.

* What is the format?
* What are the rules?
* Can we get a copy of those rules?

In every room there is description of the necessary roles, guidelines, and goals.
Whiteboards in the rooms
Whiteboards in the halls

Some Rules:

* Declare that it is a Safe Room/Space
* Answer the question quickly, and give resources to answer
* Someone will adopt the role of the "Keeper of the Heart".

> The keeper knows when to ask the person that is asking questions if they could have someone follow with them later. That person would help explain more details that this persons needs.

> It good to have a variety of voices. From experiences (work/life) and training. Good mixture of Chef people and other individuals.

> One answer per question if its not off base.

> Defining all the TERMS! Define all the THINGS!
