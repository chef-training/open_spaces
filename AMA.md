# Ask Me Anything (AMA)

Some Rules:

* Declare that it is a Safe Room/Space
* Answer the question quickly, and give resources to answer
* Someone will adopt the role of the "Keeper of the Heart".

> The keeper knows when to ask the person that is asking questions if they could have someone follow with them later. That person would help explain more details that this persons needs.

> It good to have a variety of voices. From experiences (work/life) and training. Good mixture of Chef people and other individuals.

> One answer per question if its not off base.

> Defining all the TERMS! Define all the THINGS!
