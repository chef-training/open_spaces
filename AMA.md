### Rules:
* Attendees
  * The law of mobility -- if you feel (for any reason) that this session isn't the right one for you to be in, you should leave. No hard feelings!
  * Try to have a variety of voices from experiences (work/life) and training, including a decent mixture of Chef Software & community members.

* Beginners
  * No question is off limits.
  * If you have more detailed questions about a topic, make a plan to meet up with a specific individual afterward who can do a deeper dive into a topic for you.
* Experts
  * Stick to one answer per question whenever possible.
  * If you mention a resource, make sure to pass the URL/author name/info along to the note taker.

  * All questions get voiced, and all terms get defined.

We can't write down all the rules to make this work, but what we can do is empower you to make the right decisions in the moment.
